# Overview
They say too many cooks spoil the broth, however nobody said anything about too
many engineers.

This repo is a place to organize meals for the residential interns working at
[Tagup](https://www.tagup.io).  

## Installation
To install the calcurse calendar app just run ```sudo apt-get install calcurse``` on
Debian, or ```brew install calcurse``` on OS X. 

## Opening the Calendar
After you've installed ```Calcurse``` (see Installation above), you can open
our calendar by executing ```./schedule```. Make sure you're in the ```meals```
directory, or calcurse will not source the correct calendar. 

## Procedure
At the beginning of every week, the interns will meet up to discuss what food
to prepare for the following week. Based off of this they'll create a shopping
list for the upcoming week and order their food from
[peapod](https://www.peapod.com).  Ivraj will assign meals through git issues. 

## Other Notes
