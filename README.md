# Overview
They say too many cooks spoil the broth, however nobody said anything about too
many engineers.

This repo is a place to organize meals for the residential interns working at
[Tagup](tagup.io).  

## Procedure
At the beginning of every week, the interns will meet up to discuss what food
to prepare for the following week. Based off of this they'll create a shopping
list for the upcoming week and order their food from [peapod](www.peapod.com).
Ivraj will assign meals through git issues.
